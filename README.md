# KU Medical Center Portfolio
Hello! I'm Breck Emert, a data science and machine learning student currently completing my Master's in Applied Statistics at KU Med.  I'm concurrently researching with the department of biostatistics as the leader of the KU Med AI Research Group, as well as with KU's Brain, Behavior and Quantitative Science program.

This repository showcases my portfolio of advanced projects and analyses completed during my Master's in Applied Statistics and Data Science at KU Med. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in advance statistics, modeling, and data science.

## Skills Highlighted Here:

- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis
- Computational Neuroscience
- Programming Languages: Python, R, SAS

## Projects

Below are some of the projects I've completed during my studies.  

### [Brain-Inspired Temporal Attention in Transformers](https://github.com/BreckEmert/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/Temporal%20Attention.pdf)

*In Progress*   
This paper proposes a novel and interpretable attention mechanism which reduces the computational load of attention.  It is inspired by neuroscience and is accompanied by an extensive review of supporting literature.  I am currently performing extensive testing of its performance and interpretability using [my transformer model](https://github.com/BreckEmert/Coding-SLM) as the foundation.

### [A Statistical Examination of Factors Impacting Market Share in the Packaged Foods Industry](https://github.com/BreckEmert/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/Emert%20823%20Analysis.pdf)

This collaborative project was completed for my Statistical Programming in R course taken in my first semester.  Our team aimed  for this study to determine the factors that influence market share for an individual project offered by a large packaged goods manufacturer.  We used regression modeling to pick an actionable model and make recommendations for the companies' course of action.

Data analysis and visualization conducted in R.  Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection, Auto-correlation, and Residual Analysis

### [Housing Affordability in the United States](https://github.com/BreckEmert/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/Emert%20840%20Analysis.pdf)

This study was completed for my Linear Regression course taken in my first semester.  Through this study, I aimed to highlight population density factors for determining rental prices in the United States, as a contribution to help back our political conversations with data.

Data analysis and visualization conducted in R.  Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection, Component-Residuals, and ANOVA.
