## Projects

Below are some of the projects I've completed during my studies.

### [A Statistical Examination of Factors Impacting Market Share in the Packaged Foods Industry](https://github.com/BreckEmert/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/Emert%20823%20Analysis.pdf)

This collaborative project was completed for my Statistical Programming in R course.  Our team aimed  for this study to determine the factors that influence market share for an individual project offered by a large packaged goods manufacturer.  We used regression modeling to pick an actionable model and make recommendations for the companies' course of action.

Data analysis and visualization conducted in R.  Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection, Auto-correlation, and Residual Analysis

### [Housing Affordability in the United States](https://github.com/BreckEmert/KUMedPortfolio/blob/main/Emert%20840%20Analysis.pdf)

This study was completed for my Linear Regression course.  Through this study, I aimed to highlight population density factors for determining rental prices in the United States, as a contribution to help back our political conversations with data.

Data analysis and visualization conducted in R.  Statistical methods used include Automatic Model Selection, Component-Residuals, and ANOVA.
